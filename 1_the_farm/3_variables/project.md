# 1.3 Project: Mad Lib

This lesson, you are going to write a mad lib! Create a new file and give it a file extension of `.py`. This is where you will put your mad lib script.

Come up with a short story in a series of printed lines, like this:

```python
print("One line of the story might look like this")
print("The next line like this")
```

Now, pull out interesting parts of the mad lib to store as variables at the top of your file. Your file might look something like this:

```python
# user selections
animal = "opossum"
farm_task = "irrigating"
big_number = "cajillion"

# story

print("this is where you put your story")
print("and put in your variables in the appropriate place!")
```
