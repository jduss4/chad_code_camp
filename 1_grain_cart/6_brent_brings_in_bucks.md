Your dad wants to know about how much money all these loads are worth. You will need to add more to your program to keep track!

## Tasks

- you will need to input the going rate __once__ (per day pricing)
- you will need a variable that keeps track of how many pounds have been taken to the co-op
- you will need a function to calculate the payment
  - pass in the daily rate and the total pounds as arguments
  - you can even name the arguments if you want to!
- after each semi, report the total estimated earnings
