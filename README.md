# Intro to Programming for Farmers

This course is intended to teach the bright eyed and eager Chad how to program, using friendly lessons from around the farm.

This course spans multiple weeks, and each week is composed of several lessons.  The structure of a lesson is:

- introduction: an overview of the concepts being introduced
- practice: a set of small, math-homework style problems to work through
- application: on exciting weeks, you'll have a more involved project to work on
