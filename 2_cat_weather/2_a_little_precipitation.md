# A Little Precipitation

- lists
- math with floats

It was a rainy week, and your dad was under the weather with a head cold. He asked your mom to write down how many "tenths" and "hundredths" you've been getting, so she has been keeping a list all week on paper.

She comments to you that it would be easier if there was a cool Python program she could use to add them up. That's your cue!

Write a python program with a short list of rainfall amounts (0.08, 0.25, etc) and add them together.

Wouldn't it be easier just to add each number without using a list? Sure, but then you wouldn't be learning about lists, would you?!

## Tasks

- create a `list` or `tuple` (your choice) of the rainfall amounts as floats
- iterate through the list and do something with each of the amounts to add it to the others

Hint:

- consider adding a variable to keep track of the total rainfall
