# It's Good Code, Brent

- Code organization
- Documentation

This thing is starting to get a little long! Identify a chunk or two that you think could be pulled out into a function.

Additionally, this program should run automatically when calling the file, so read about `main()` & set it up!

Also, add some comments to explain what all the parts of your code are doing. You can add a comment by starting the line with `#`

## Tasks

- put the bulk of your code in `main()`
- pull some code into a function of your choice
- add comments above your new functions to explain what they do
- add comments at the top to introduce the script to new devs (or you in a few years)
