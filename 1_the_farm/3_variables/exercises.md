### Names

Check out these variable names and decide if you think they're a good or bad idea and why:

1. combine_type
1. cattleEgret
1. Bean_amount
1. bean_amount
1. 1week
1. week1
1. weight

### Create your own

Create some variables and assign values to them (`age = 33` or `crop = "Beans"`). Now try to combine them to create mega-variables:  `mega = str(age) + " " + crop`. When you're done, use `print()` with your mega variable! Make sure you use a variety of different data types in your variables.

## Solutions

### Names

1. combine_type: probably fine!
1. cattleEgret: avoid "camel case" in favor of snake case
1. Bean_amount: no uppercase first letter!
1. bean_amount: this one seems great :)
1. 1week: don't start with a number
1. week1: this is technically fine, although maybe consider `week_1` instead for readability
1. weight: this is okay, but you would want to make sure that it makes sense wherever you are using it, as "weight" is fairly general and could easily be confused for something else in a longer script

### Create your own

Did you have any trouble? Did you figure out how to space everything, and convert stuff to strings where appropriate?
