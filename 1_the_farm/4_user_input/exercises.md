# 1.4 Exercises

I've only got a few things for you here, but the fun stuff is all in the [project](project.md)!

## Exercises

1. Write a short script that does something mathy, similar to the example in the lecture. Get user input, run a calculation, and then print it back out to them.
1. Write a short script which combines some words. Maybe ask for a first name + last name, or combine foods to make an ice cream flavor, etc, it doesn't matter just so long as you use some user input!
