# First function and improving user experience

Your users are having trouble continuing your script. You find that some people are entering different things than you expected, like:

- 0/1
- t/f
- Y/N

Create a function to check multiple ways a user may want to continue and plug it into your script.

## Tasks

- the function may take 0 or 1 arguments, depending on how / when you are getting user input
- the function needs to return a value to set the variable used by your `while` loop
- check multiple possible user inputs and refine your message to help guide them
