# Intro to Programming for Farmers

This course is intended to teach the bright eyed and eager Chad how to program, using friendly lessons from around the farm.

This course spans multiple weeks, and each week is composed of several lessons.  The structure of a lesson is:

- introduction: an overview of the concepts being introduced
- exercises: a set of small, math-homework style problems to work through
- project: on exciting weeks, you'll have a more involved problem to work on

On the "Friday" or 5th lesson of each week, you will either have a little more practice on tricky concepts, or you will a lesson about being a polite, world-wise programmer. It might be a lesson about how to document your code, or talking about user-centered design -- who knows where my flights of fancy shall take us!
