1.4 Project

Remember how last lesson you built a [mad lib](/1_the_farm/3_variables/project.md)? Wasn't that fun? Wouldn't it be more fun if it asked the user for input instead of using some preset values?

Your assignment is to copy your script from 1.3's project and set it up to use user input for all the nouns / verbs / adjectives / etc.
