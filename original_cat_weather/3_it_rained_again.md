# It Rained Again!

- combining lists

Your precipitation calculation script was working great, until it rained for a second week, too.  Your dad was back on his feet this week, but he decided to keep using your script so he made a second list for this latest rainy week.

Now you have two lists of rainfall amounts that you need to sum!

## Tasks

- add another list of rainfall amounts
- calculate the total rainfall for EACH week
- combine the lists into a mega list and figure out how much rainfall you've gotten total!

Hint:

- it may behoove you to use a function for calculating totals, since you will otherwise have to write the same thing 3 times!
